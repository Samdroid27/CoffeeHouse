## Working of the Blockchain

For demonstration purposes, we have created 3 nodes at ports 5000, 5001, 5002 to
create a decentralized blockchain and used Postman for API calls and presenting
the corresponding response.

**A Block contains:**
>* Block Index
>* Previous Hash
>* Nonce
>* Timestamp
>* Transactions

**The difficulty level to mine a block :**
>A valid hash using SHA256 should have four leading zeros.

**During verification, two constraints are checked for the validity of blockchain:**
>1. The previous hash matches the hash of the previous block
>1. Hash of the current block has 4 leading zeros

**API calls available**
